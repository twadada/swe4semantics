# swe4semantics
This repositiory provides static word embeddings (SWEs) proposed in our paper "Static Word Embeddings for Sentence Semantic Representation".

Monolingual (English) and cross-lingual (English-{German/Japanese/Chinese}) SWEs are stored in the "embeddings" folder. Refer to "example.py" for how to use English SWEs, and "example_xling.py" for how to use cross-lignual ones.
