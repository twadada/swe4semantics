This repositiory provides code and models proposed in our paper "Static Word Embeddings for Sentence Semantic Representation" (EMNLP 25).

English and cross-lingual (English-{German/Japanese/Chinese}) SWEs (static word embeddings) are both stored in the "embeddings" folder. Refer to "example.py" for how to use English SWEs, and "example_xling.py" for cross-lignual ones.

All SWEs, except for the English-Japanese one ("swe_mgte256_enja.txt"), are released under the Apache license 2.0. The English-Japanese one follows [the license of JParaCrawl](https://www.kecl.ntt.co.jp/icl/lirg/jparacrawl/).
