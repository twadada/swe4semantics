# swe4semantics
This repositiory provides static word embeddings (SWEs) proposed in our paper "Static Word Embeddings for Sentence Semantic Representation", as well as simple code descring how to use them for measuring semantic similarities of sentences.

SWEs are stored in the "embeddings" folder. Refer to "example.py" for how to use English SWEs, and "example_xling.py" for how to use cross-lignual ones.
